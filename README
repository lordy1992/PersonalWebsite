Personal Site w/ the Play Framework
===========================================================================================================

This is a project I began working on to learn Scala and the Play Framework. It is a dynamic personal website with a blog section, articles section (for fiction rather than technical articles), and an editable resume.

Generating an Admin Password
------------------------------

I assume python and pip is installed. We can use the python bcrypt library and the -c flag with python to hash on the console.

Here are the steps that can be taken to generate the password and store it in an appropriate file in the server (in a location that
can only be accessed by root). Note that we pass the prefix argument to gensalt to ensure the prefix is 2a, so that it is compatible with the
bcrypt library used in Play.

Note that the script generateHash.py referred to here is in the scripts directory of this project.

pip install bcrypt
python generateHash.py > /etc/lordweb/admin
